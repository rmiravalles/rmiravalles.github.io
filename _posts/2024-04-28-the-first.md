# Starting over

Hi!
This is my new attempt at documenting what I've been learning. 
What moved me into doing this again is my newly found passion for Kubernetes. I had taken an interest on it before,
but just recently the thing got serious.
At work, I get the chanve to see some Kubernetes, but it's superficicial. I want to dive deeper, though.
Since I'm an Azure guy, most of my project will be on AKS, but there must be a foundation. I'll start from there.
I like Linux too, so expect to find some of that here. Basic stuff, as I'm not a super hardcore Linux user, even though 
I have an Ubuntu t-shirt, and I wear it a lot.
I like music, and I've been blogging about since since I was a kid. I'll sprinkle some music here too.
