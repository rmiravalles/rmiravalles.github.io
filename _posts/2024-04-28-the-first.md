# Starting over

Hi!
This is my new attempt at documenting what I've been learning. My previous blog is now deactivated. I saved the aticles, though, and some of them weren't too bad. I may publish some of them here.

What moved me into doing this again is my newly found passion for Kubernetes. I had taken an interest on it before, but just recently the thing got serious.

At work, I get the chance to see some Kubernetes, but it's superficicial. I want to dive deeper, though.
Since I'm an Azure guy, most of my projects will be on AKS, but there must be a foundation. I'll start from there.

I like Linux too, so expect to find some of that here. Basic stuff, as I'm not a super hardcore Linux user, even though I have an Ubuntu t-shirt, and I wear it a lot.

I love music, and I've been blogging about it since since I was a kid. I'll sprinkle some music here too.
