# A new Machine, new adventures

I finally bought a new laptop. It's a Lenovo again. I keep reading that Lenovos are the best to run Linux. I can't complain a bit. It all runs smoothly out of the box.

My new Lenovo is running the new Noble Numbat Ubuntu. I'm digging it so far. I still have a lot to tweak, to install and to configure.

This post is just a test, to see if I got the things right here.
