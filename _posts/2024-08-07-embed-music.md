# What I've been listening to

Today I found that I can embed YouTube videos in my articles. That was a super exciting discovery!

There are two ways to do it. I can simply paste the iframe code directly in the Markdown file, or I can use an include file. I went for the second option. Let's see if it works!

# José Gonzalez

These days I've been listening to [José Gonzalez](https://jose-gonzalez.com/) a lot. I love his voice and his style. It's soothing and delicate, but it has some slight roughness to it too. He was born in Sweden, to Argentinian parents.

This is his version of Massive Attack's Teardrop. The video is incredible too!

Expect more music here, now that I know how to embed videos. :)
